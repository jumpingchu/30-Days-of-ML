    "# Three Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) A Simple Option: Drop Columns with Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest option is to drop columns with missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "![tut2_approach1](https://i.imgur.com/Sax80za.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach.  As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) A Better Option: Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation** fills in the missing values with some number.  For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "![tut2_approach2](https://i.imgur.com/4BpnlPA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) An Extension To Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![tut3_approach3](https://i.imgur.com/UWOyg4a.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before.  And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home).  Our model will use information such as the number of rooms and land size to predict home price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`. "

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For much of this course, you have made predictions with the random forest method, which achieves better performance than a single decision tree simply by averaging the predictions of many decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the random forest method as an \"ensemble method\".  By definition, **ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several models (e.g., several trees, in the case of random forests).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll learn about another ensemble method called gradient boosting.  \n",

    "# Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient boosting** is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive.  (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset.  To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.  \n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like [mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), for instance).\n",
    "- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble.  Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss.  (*Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.*)\n",
    "- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n",

    "[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a the leading software library for working with standard tabular data (the type of data you store in Pandas DataFrames, as opposed to more exotic types of data like images and videos).  With careful parameter tuning, you can train highly accurate models. \n",
